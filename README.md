# Forge Engine

Forge Engine is a modern, modular PHP framework built with a focus on developer experience, performance, and leveraging the latest PHP features.

## Framework Philosophy

At its core, Forge Engine is guided by the following principles:

* **Embrace Modern PHP:** Forge is built from the ground up using the latest advancements in PHP, including attributes for streamlined configuration, enums for type safety and clarity, strict typing for enhanced code reliability, and more. We believe in leveraging the full potential of the language to create a more robust and enjoyable development experience.
* **Modularity First:** Forge adopts a highly modular architecture. This means that core functionalities and features are implemented as independent modules. Developers can choose and integrate only the modules they need, leading to leaner applications with fewer dependencies. This promotes flexibility and makes the framework highly adaptable to various project requirements.
* **Developer Experience Focused:** We are committed to providing a clean, intuitive, and well-documented framework. Our goal is to make building complex applications with Forge as straightforward and efficient as possible. Clear conventions, helpful error messages, and comprehensive documentation are top priorities.
* **Independent Package Management:** Forge features its own dedicated Package Manager, designed specifically for managing Forge modules. This allows for seamless installation, updates, and removal of modules, fostering a rich ecosystem of reusable components that can be easily integrated into your projects. The Package Manager operates independently, allowing for greater control and customization of your application's features.
* **Performance Conscious:** While prioritizing developer experience and modern practices, Forge is also engineered with performance in mind. By leveraging modern PHP features and following best practices, we aim to deliver a framework that is both powerful and efficient.
