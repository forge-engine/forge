# Forge Engine - Craft Your Web Applications

Imagine a blacksmith at their forge. They have the heat, the hammer, and the tools to shape raw materials into powerful creations. That's the essence of **Forge Engine**. It's a personal project built from a desire to explore a different paradigm in PHP web development, offering you, the developer (the blacksmith), a lean, modular, and performant foundation to craft your web applications – your powerful tools and creations.

Forge Engine is built with a focus on leveraging the latest PHP features, providing a unique blend of speed and control, empowering you to forge your digital masterpieces.

## Framework Philosophy

Just like a skilled blacksmith understands their materials and tools, Forge Engine was created with the following guiding principles in mind:

* **Embrace Modern PHP - The Raw Materials:** Forge is built from the ground up using the latest advancements in PHP, including attributes, enums, and strict typing. We believe in harnessing the full potential of the language – your raw materials – for a more robust and enjoyable development experience.
* **True Modularity - The Interchangeable Tools:** Forge adopts a fully modular architecture where core functionalities are implemented as truly independent modules. This allows you to choose and integrate only the modules you need, like selecting the right tool for the job, leading to exceptionally lean applications with minimal dependencies. This design promotes flexibility and adaptability for various project scales.
* **Focus on Developer Understanding - Mastering the Craft:** We are committed to providing a framework that is clear, intuitive, and well-documented. Our goal is to empower you with a deep understanding of your application's inner workings, avoiding "magic" and promoting explicit control over your craft.
* **Independent Module Management - Your Personal Toolkit:** Forge features its own straightforward Package Manager, designed specifically for managing Forge modules. This allows for seamless installation, updates, and removal of modules, fostering a rich ecosystem of reusable components – your personal toolkit – that can be easily integrated into your projects, all without relying on external package managers.
* **Performance through Design - The Heat of the Forge:** While not the sole focus, Forge's architecture, leveraging modern PHP and a modular approach, naturally leads to efficient resource utilization and fast execution, allowing you to forge your creations quickly and effectively.
