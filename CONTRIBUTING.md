# Contributing to Forge

Forge is a builder’s toolbox. If you’ve got something to add or fix — awesome.

This isn’t a corporate repo. You don’t need to sound fancy or use the right "enterprise words" to contribute.

Just be:
- Clear
- Honest
- Respectful

## Reporting Issues

Use plain language. Tell me what’s broken, what’s missing, or what could be better. Screenshots help. So do examples.

### Example:
> When installing on PHP 8.2, the `forge.php` script throws an undefined constant error.

Good enough.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b fix/fix-name
```
3. Make your changes
4. Push and open a pull request

In the PR, just explain what you did and why. Doesn’t need to be long.

### Example:
> Fixes storage bug when uploading to nested folders. Added a test case to confirm.

If your PR touches core parts, I might suggest tweaks or ask questions — no hard feelings, just builders building.

## Style & Structure

- Use PHP 8+ features
- Stick to the existing file layout unless it really needs changing
- No dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Keep things simple

## Thanks

Seriously, thanks. You’re helping me build something better — for me, you, and whoever else finds it useful.
