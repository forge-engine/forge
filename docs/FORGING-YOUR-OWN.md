# FORGING-YOUR-OWN.md

So you want to build your own version of Forge?
Awesome ‚Äî this doc will walk you through exactly what to fork, what to change, and how to get your own system up and running.

---

## Overview
Forge is modular and transparent by design, and everything lives in public repositories under the [forge-engine](https://github.com/forge-engine) GitHub org.

You can fork any part ‚Äî just the modules, just the starter, or the whole system.

If you're going all in, here's what to do.

---

## üß¨ Repositories to Fork

To fully own and rebrand your Forge stack, fork the following repositories:

### Core Framework
- [forge-engine/framework](https://github.com/forge-engine/framework) ‚Äì the minimal core framework (DI, routing, bootstrapping, routing, view engine, database and orm)

### Registry
- [forge-engine/framework-registry](https://github.com/forge-engine/framework-registry) ‚Äì maps module names to GitHub URLs (used by the package manager)

### Starter Template
- [forge-engine/forge-starter](https://github.com/forge-engine/forge-starter) ‚Äì a ready-to-go project template with minimal setup

### Modules
- [forge-engine/modules](https://github.com/forge-engine/modules) ‚Äì all optional, official Forge modules live here (auth, storage, logger, etc.)

### Installer
- [forge-engine/installer](https://github.com/forge-engine/installer) ‚Äì bash script for bootstrapping a new project quickly

### (Optional) Docs
- [forge-engine/forge-engine.github.io](https://github.com/forge-engine/forge-engine.github.io) ‚Äì the documentation site
- [forge-engine/forge-schemas](https://github.com/forge-engine/forge-schemas) ‚Äì schema definitions for module manifests, etc.

### Main Dev Repo
- [forge-engine/forge](https://github.com/forge-engine/forge) ‚Äì the full repo containing all modules, installer, and framework glued together. This is mostly for local dev.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What to Change

### 1. Package Manager Service
In your fork of the framework, update the `PackageManagerService`:

```php
#[Service]
#[Provides(interface: PackageManagerInterface::class, version: '0.1.0')]
#[Requires()]
final class PackageManagerService implements PackageManagerInterface
{
	use OutputHelper;

	private const OFFICIAL_REGISTRY_NAME = 'your-org-modules';
	private const OFFICIAL_REGISTRY_BASE_URL = 'https://github.com/your-org/modules';
	private const OFFICIAL_REGISTRY_BRANCH = 'main';
	private const FRAMEWORK_MODULE_NAME = 'your-org/framework';
	private const PACKAGE_MANAGER_MODULE_NAME = 'forge-package-manager'; // Or rename it
}
```

### 2. Installer Script
In your fork of the installer repo, edit `installer.sh`:

```bash
STARTER_REPO_BASE_URL="https://github.com/your-org/forge-starter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
```

### 3. install.php Scripts
In both:
- `forge/installer/install.php`
- `forge-starter/install.php`

Update the framework URL:

```php
const FRAMEWORK_REPO_URL = 'https://github.com/your-org/framework-registry';
```

### 4. Starter Updates
In your `forge-starter` fork:
- Replace the `forge-package-manager` module with your version (after modifying it)
- Update `.env.example`, `composer.json`, and docs if needed

### 5. Optional Module Prefix Rename
If you want, you can rename all module prefixes from `Forge` to something else. This takes some work:
- Rename namespaces and folder names in each module
- Adjust module manifest files (`forge.json`)
- Update your registry entries

I might release a script to help with this ‚Äî or maybe not. Depends on time and demand.

---

## ‚úÖ Done
After forking, updating URLs, and optionally renaming modules ‚Äî you‚Äôve got your own framework stack.

At this point, Forge becomes a base you control fully. Fork it, ship it, and evolve it how you want.

You're not a user. You're a builder.
